Data Science is one of the fastest growing interdisciplinary field and has many applications in various disciplines. The actual motivation of data science came from
John Tukey. In his seminal paper, in 1962, he presented the idea of data analysis which is now the field of data science. Several algorithms for data science related
to statistical analysis have been developed and applied over variety of datasets since 1962. In this field, the significant development began with the aid of high 
performance computers that help to analyse a massive datasets. In this paper, we study the statistical analysis of the traffic stops in Nashville, Tennessee, USA for 
the year 2011â€“2021. Data is taken from the Stanford open policing project. Analysis is based on total number of 3071706 traffic stops. In this paper, we consider and 
investigate various aspects. This study comprises gender comparison (male vs female) and race comparison (black vs white) for different traffic offences.
